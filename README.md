PyXploitHost - A multiplatform implementation of PiXploitHost
-------------------------------------------------------------

This is made with the intention of making PiXploitHost work on anything and not just a raspberry pi because not everybody has one :3

Exploits go in the `/http/ps4/exploits` folder.

To run the servers you run both `http_server.py` and `dns_proxy.py`, the DNS proxy will tell you the IP you need to enter into your console for the DNS server.

**Testers needed, if you have an exploitable PS4 and are willing to test message me.**
